['Biology', " he is funny, adorable, and really seems to care about how his students do, but the exam questions are vaguely worded and sometimes confusing. the coursepack is lightly helpful, but the practice exams he posts are easier than the actual exams which doesn't help. reading the book is a good idea to clarify things in lecture. the book is great "]

['Mathematics', " i had him for precalc he's one of the best math professor in um-d. he is very helpful and clear. he gives you 4 tests and 6 quizzes that are straight out of the hw. you don't have to turn in the hw but you should do it since the tests and quizzes are taken from it. i dont understand why he does not have good reviews but he really makes precalc easy "]
['Mathematics', " probably one of the best math teachers i've had since high school. his class is very easy and gets to the point. i took it at night, and the setting was very mellow. he follows the textbook and he gives homework online - do the online hw! he doesn't grade the textbook homework. quzzies and exams are straight to the point - but he's a picky grader.

['Mathematics', " he explains the material very well in class. he doesn't have a relationship with students, though. he is a nerd who is very precise, especially when grading. very tough grader! any little mistake is marked down. lots of homework every night 4 exams 6 quizzes, 1 cumulative final. no drops or curves. do every single homework assignment you might pass "]
['Mathematics', ' great guy terrible professor he just walks through the examples in the book without asking the class if they have questions then gives the homework he gives tons of problems for homework none of which are graded but if you dont do the homework you will not understand the material because he sucks at teaching. no curves or drops and cumulative final ']
['Mathematics', ' really nice guy and very helpful. the only thing i didnt like was that your grade is entirely based on the 4 tests and 6 quizzes. no homework is ever graded. so if you mess up on a test youre pretty much screwed. also the questions are very straight forward and are just like the homework questions. i would recommend him to anyone!!

"]
['Chemistry', " i liked orgo 2 much better than orgo 1 and part of it was koreeda. he's just a good prof. he is helpful and he holds review sessions before each exam (he gives out a lot of hints and even tells you which mechanisms to know). great prof, great class. too bad he's not teaching non-honors 215 anymore.

['Chemistry', " koreeda is one of my favorite professors so far. he gives out handouts of all his notes which are incredible. he basically tells you what is on the exam if you go to his review sessions. he holds expanded office hours and multiple review sessions right before an exam. he's also very funny. can't go wrong with him.

['Chemistry', ' hard class and struggled in the beginning but after i talked to him he helped me one on one in my weak areas. i feel that the best way to get a good grade in his class is to do his tb problems and the coursepack! ']
['Chemistry', " hard class, but he wants you to do well. he holds office hours pretty much every day and even is willing to meet with students on a 1-on-1 basis. furthermore, he's taken the time to condense the textbook into very useful notes that serve as great study guides for the exams. a very rare and giving personality. this guy makes u of m look good. "]
['Chemistry', " to say this class is hard, is an understatement. koreeda makes it manageable, his notes are what saves you! going to discussion or his office hours are very helpful. he'll tell you what to expect on the exam (especially the 18-25 point questions). it was difficult coming from nolta to him, it just takes time to adjust.

['Biology', " kurdziel is a nice person but the class itself it not the most exciting. exams are hard and the class is designed so that you can only lose so many points to get an a-. they won't consider any grade bumps even if you are only 0.01% from the cutoff. 171 is conceptually easier than 172 but that does not mean it is easier to get a good grade "]
['Biology', ' she is a nice lady who clearly loves biology, btu unless you love biology too this class is awful. i was bored most of the time except for in discussion. it was hard to keep up because she jams so much material into one lecture. take if you love biology. ']

"]
['Biology', " kurdziel is nice and all that, but her exams don't really reflect the difficulty of the practice exams she posts. the concepts are easier than 172, but this doesn't make the class easier to get a better grade in. if you're good at math/physics you will really like the hardy-weinberg and population growth stuff. "]
['Biology', " unless you absolutely adore biology, this class is going to be boring no matter what. kurdziel wasn't the most interesting professor, but she got the material through pretty clearly. i recommend her because she's not a bad lecturer, the subject is just kind of boring. you will fall asleep during the lectures.

['Biology', " dr. kurdziel is a pretty good professor. i wouldn't say she's the friendliest, and she doesn't always respond to emails. other than that, she's very clear and provides plenty of resources (like old exams.) just study the slides and you'll be fine. "]
['Mathematics', " his accent is thick. sit up front if you want to hear him clearly. if you do not understand something, speak up and tell him or else he'll move on to the next chapter! he drops two of the worst tests. homework all together is worth 100 pts, there is an essay on numeration systems on chapter 4 of concepts and surveys math book.

['Mathematics', ' you basically have to teach yourself everything. he has a thick accent and uses all his examples from the book. however, he is a generous grader. tests are short and fair and he drops your lowest test score at the end of the semester. also, you must do the math lab because it teaches you the material better than he does. ']
['Mathematics', ' if your expecting the professor to teach you anything, your out of luck. he uses his examples straight out of the book and has a heavy accent, making it hard to understand him. also, he will bolt out the door after class before most students would. however, he is a very generous grader and keeps exams short. he also drops your lowest test scores. ']
['Mathematics', ' i have enjoyed dr.quabili he is an excellent instructor, who gives every student a chance to succeed. he is available.the only drawbacks are he tends to be an easy grader and he uses the textbook examples instead of giving his own, which i think would be more helpful.however dr. quabili is an excellent professor who always encourages his students.

['Mathematics', ' leaving a negative rating on rmp is worthless nowadays, they just delete it. so i will just describe the professor in the comment, and say he is horrible. i got an a in the class, but he reads right out the book. only thing he teaches good is functions. take it with someone who knows how to teach. only online homework is important ']
['Mathematics', ' he is a great professor who makes math fun and enjoyable. i usually do really bad in math, but in his class i did very well and ended with a. he is always open to questions and helps make all the hard concepts easy! i would recommend him, especially if you are not a math person. he will help you every step of the way!

['Biology', " yes, his exams are harder than olsen's, yes he is not as clear as olsen, and yes the material is harder than with olsen. but cadigan is not as bad as the reviews make him seen. not the best professor, but not the worst. if you put in the time, you will do fine on his exams. "]
['Biology', " not as clear as olsen. he's a really nice guy but he lacks clarity. cadigan is the type of guy who'll give you half a concept, then test you on the other half. overall, he's ok. some of his lecture slides are &quot;empty&quot;. but he provides supplement notes which is nice. "]
['Biology', " ngeh, not the best teacher i've had but he's not terrible. sometimes he seems condescending but nothing i can't handle. i just don't like how in his exam questions, all of the answers are correct but one is more correct than the others. just gets confusing. "]
['Biology', " geez so much whining... his exams were comparable in difficulty if not easier than olson's exams. as opposed to olson's, cadigan's lecture slides are clear and he also posts detailed microsoft word outlines of his lectures. if you actively rehearse the material, you will do well on his exam. take it from someone who did way worse on olson's exams.

['Biology', ' awesome professor! extremely intelligent and still able to clearly explain concepts. the material he taught was fascinating and he was always very friendly and willing to help any students having trouble. ']
['Biology', ' not bad at all! wow, how lazy are you people&#63; go to lecture, take notes (its college) and read the book if you want further explanation. discussion prepares you for short answers and althought the mc is tricky at times, its doable. ']
['Biology', " he's not bad. his exams are tricky, but the short answers are pretty similar to what we do in discussion. the multiple choice is pretty straightforward for the post part. if you study a decent amount you will do well. "]
['Biology', " i don't understand the previous comments. i have never seen him be condescending or unhelpful. he is extremely smart and teaches the material well. the exam average went down, but i found the material much easier than the first half of the class. not as bad as people are making him out to be!!

['Biology', ' he is so cool! very fun teacher and very smart! any question i asked him he knew right away, and was very interested in what i thought and what i was doing at the time. his exams however were rough, but that is because the topic is rough. ']
['Biology', " some claim cadigan is not condescending or rude but he is. in an exam review he laughed at a student's question, but was then unable to answer it. after a gibberish explanation he assured the class &quot;you won't need to worry about that,&quot; but the concept was worth 12 points on the exam. if he's unavoidable, you'll survive, but try to get someone else. "]
['Biology', " he comes off initially as uncaring but he's actually a really nice guy and does want students to succeed. the upper level bio classes are much harder, so he is preparing you! attend lecture, write down as much as you can that comes out of his mouth, and study hard; you'll be fine "]
['Biology', ' dr. cadigan is a pretty bad professor. his exams are hard, but not impossible. his lectures are fast-paced. he is not clear on most topics and often has to re-explain them the next lecture. if your gsi is good and you study a lot, you will do fine. ']
['Biology', " dr. cadigan is not very clear and an awkward lecturer. his exams were overly difficult and do not accurately access student's understanding of the material. i dreaded going to lecture because he would also include lots of irrelevant material. "]
['Biology', ' to be honest i had my doubts about cadigan at first due to all the rumors i heard. but in reality he is not bad. you do need to go to lecture and read the book, but i thought exams were fair. bio 172 is supposed to be tough, and you need to put in the work. it is possible to get a good grade with cadigan. ']
['Biology', " the class is difficult...get over it! cadigan was a fine lecturer. i suppose he's labeled as &quot;condescending&quot; because he refuses to allow students to talk and screw around while he's lecturing&#63; exams were hard, but not outrageous as so many here are claiming...if you go to lecuture, and read the book like you're supposed to, it's not all that bad. "]
['Biology', ' heed this warning. do not take bio 172 with professor cadigan. he expects you to know the most random things in great detail, stuff he barely even mentions during lecture. his exams will kill your gpa, they hardly touch upon what we focus on in lecture at all. take this class with anyone else as a professor than him. the reviews dont lie. ']
['Biology', " dr. cadigan was a poor professor because he did not explain concepts clearly- it seemed like he didn't fully understand them. when he did understand something, he overexplained then claimed &quot;you don't need to know that&quot; many questions were answered &quot;don't worry about that&quot; and you &quot;don't need to know the details&quot; "]
